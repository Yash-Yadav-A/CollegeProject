    <h4>Professional Machine Learning Skills to Help Your Career Grow</h4>
      <ul type="disc">According to TechRepublic, machine learning engineers must be skilled in the following:
        <li>Computer science fundamentals</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Math and statistics</li>
        <li>Data science</li>
        <li>Deep learning</li>
        <li>Problem solving</li>
        <li>Software engineering and system design</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
        Soft skills are also extremely valuable in machine learning positions. These include:
        <li>Teamwork</li>
        <li>Good communication</li>
        <li>Organization</li>
        <li>Strong Work ethic</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps Toward a Career in Machine Learning</h3>
<h4>Undergraduate degree</h4>
<br> first step toward establishing a career in machine learning is to secure an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, data science, computer programming or related field.
<h4>Advance degree</h4>
<br> most machine learning careers, an undergraduate degree will not suffice. A master’s in computer science, software engineering, artificial intelligence or machine learning can expand your knowledge and skills, and advance your career. Core machine learning courses may include computer science, high-level mathematics, applied machine learning, statistics, research, data analysis, artificial intelligence and more.

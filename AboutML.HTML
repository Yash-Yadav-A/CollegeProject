    <div class="paragraph">    <p> 
            Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
            First, let’s explore the definition of machine learning, which is categorized as a subsection (or type) of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is “all about extracting valuable information from data” — which could be anything from text and video to images and sound. As the name implies, the ability to learn is what separates machine learning from other AI subsets. 

“Machine learning is a branch of AI that gives computer systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience, rather than being explicitly programmed. In machine learning, computers use massive sets of data and apply algorithms to train on and make predictions,” according to TechRepublic.

When it comes to real-life applications, tech site ZDNet reports, “From driving cars to translating speech, machine learning is driving an explosion in the capabilities of artificial intelligence – helping software make sense of the messy and unpredictable real world.”

According to MIT Technology Review, “Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today — recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.”

            Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. (IBM)

            Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. (SAS)
            
            Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases. (MathWorks).

        <div class="head3"><h1>Types of Machine Learning </h1></div>
    <div class="paragraph2"><p><ol type="1>"><li><b>Supervised Machine Learning:</b></li>
         <br>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is trained on the labeled dataset. It learns to map input features to targets based on labeled training data. In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with input features and corresponding output labels, and it learns to generalize from this data to make predictions on new, unseen data.</li>
         <br><h4>There are two main types of supervised learning</h4>
         <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Regression: </b>Regression is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict continuous values based on input features. The output labels in regression are continuous values, such as stock prices, and housing prices. The different regression algorithms in machine learning are: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, etc</li>
            <li><b>Classification:</b> Classification is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to assign input data to a specific category or class based on input features. The output labels in classification are discrete values. Classification algorithms can be binary, where the output is one of two possible classes, or multiclass, where the output can be one of several classes. The different Classification algorithms in machine learning are: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc</li>
         </ul>
         <li><h4>Unsupervised Machine Learning:</h4></li>
         <br>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns to recognize patterns in data without being explicitly trained using labeled examples. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover the underlying structure or distribution in the data
         <h4>There are two main types of unsupervised learning:</h4>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Clustering:</b> Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their characteristics. The goal is to identify groups, or clusters, of data points that are similar to each other, while being distinct from other groups. Some popular clustering algorithms include K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.</li>
            <li><b>Dimensionality reduction:</b> Dimensionality reduction algorithms reduce the number of input variables in a dataset while preserving as much of the original information as possible. This is useful for reducing the complexity of a dataset and making it easier to visualize and analyze. Some popular dimensionality reduction algorithms include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and Autoencoders. </li>

        </ul>
        <li><h4>Reinforcement Machine Learning:</h4></li>
        Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.
        <br><h4>There are two main types of reinforcement learning:</h4>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Model-based reinforcement learning:</b> In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent learns a model of the environment, including the transition probabilities between states and the rewards associated with each state-action pair. The agent then uses this model to plan its actions in order to maximize its expected reward. Some popular model-based reinforcement learning algorithms include Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.</li>
            <li><b>Model-free reinforcement learning:</b> In model-free reinforcement learning, the agent learns a policy directly from experience without explicitly building a model of the environment. The agent interacts with the environment and updates its policy based on the rewards it receives. Some popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-Learning, SARSA, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.</li>
